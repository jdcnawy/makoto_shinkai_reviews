            <p>言の葉の庭</p>
<p>2013, 46 min.</p>

          <p>Takao Akizuki, an aspiring shoemaker and a high-school student, skips class on a rainy day to sketch shoe designs in a beautiful garden. The person who is there when he arrives is Yukari Yukino, a mysterious and beautiful woman. He offers to make her new shoes, and they continually both keep each other company in this garden on rainy days.</p>
          <p>The two of them start to grow close, each finding the company of the other a welcome change. However, as the rainy season lifts, the tensions of their relationship and the struggles everpresent in their personal lives come back out to play.</p>
          <p>The Garden of Words focuses on these two characters and their growing relationship: the navigation of an obvious age gap, inconsistent contact, and escapism are a few of the notable things that our main characters tackle together.</p>

<p>This movie's art design is simply stunning. The recurring visits to the garden are breathtaking every time, and the use of lens flares and depth of field allows for such immersion that you can actually forget about the dialogue while staring at the scenery. The soundtrack is very simple, but does its job well, adding to the scenes in a way similar to 5cm/s.</p>
<p>The relationship between Akizuki and Yukino is certainly interesting, but feels rather weird - I can't tell if it's the romantic tension that accompanies an age gap, or if it's just the length of the film constraining the development of the pair on-screen. The dialogue between the two is quite interesting, though: instead of us learning a lot through dialogue, all the conversations between the two are rather mundane. We learn about Akizuki's shoe-making interest through shots of him working. Show, don't tell.</p>
<p>The ending song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e67pR651Hdc">Rain</a>, accompanies a emotinal ending that, while feeling a little out of place, hits the spot pretty well. Overall, this film is a great watch, especially if you're into gorgeous visuals.</p>
