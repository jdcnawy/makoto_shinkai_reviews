          <p>Voices of a Distant Star is a short OVA(original video animation)that Shinkai made on his Power Mac G4. Him and his girlfriend at the time actually recorded the original voices for the only two speaking characters in the film, Mikako Nagamine and Noboru Terao. </p>
          <p>It's the year 2046, and Noboru and Mikako are friends about to graduate middle school. After an alien attack on humanity, though, Mikako is selected to join a special force that the UN has put together to fight back.</p>
          <p>The two try to keep in touch through their cell phones, but as Mikako gets farther and farther away from Earth, the time it takes to send and receive messages increases exponentially.</p>

<p>The art is definitely lacking in this film, but it's good enough, especially considering that it was made on a laptop in the early 2000s. The sound design is also just about good enough.</p>
<p>I did not expect to tear up watching this short film about two kids living in a futuristic world from two decades ago. I was wrong. The dialogue is brilliant, and really drives the themes of longing and separation home.</p>
<p>Even the ending song,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It_XwexZ_bo">"Through the Years and Far Away"</a>, serves as a reminder that not only is Mikako far away from Earth, she also ages at a different speed as well. The culmination of all these different factors really brought this OVA together for me, and I'd recommend it to many people that want a short and sweet rush of emotions.</p>
