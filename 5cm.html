            <p>秒速５センチメートル</p>
            <p>2007, 65 min.</p>
          </div>
          <p>5 Centimeters per Second is a collection of three short films that focus on two childhood friends, Takaki Toono and Akari Shinohara. They love each other dearly, but their lives tear them away from each other. Over time, their contact starts to fade, and the hope of reconnecting causes them to live their everyday lives half-heartedly.</p>
            <p>Episode 1 is dedicated to showing their relationship as kids, episode 2 shows Takaki's struggle with his new life without Akari, and episode 3 shows just how much this separation has influenced the lives of both.</p>
          <p>For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't go any deeper into the plot.</p>

<p>This set of mini-films plays with your heartstrings. The art is a little spotty in some spots due to the movie being a bit older, but it's still a tremendous piece in its own right - the details in the backgrounds, the lighting and camera angles used to accent moods in scenes, and the character design draw you in flawlessly.</p>
<p>The characters are all great, despite some of them lacking development. The plot revolves around Takagi and Akari, so the supporting characters being a little less fleshed out is fine; they do their jobs well, and help accent the main characters while having their moments. Shoutout to Kanae for pining after Takagi in the way she does - it makes her eventual heartbreak not only feel very heavy but also serves as a reminder for how tragic it is for Takagi to be dealing with his separation from Akari.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is simple and supportive - lots of non-crowded piano tracks help bring the scenes together without overstepping their boundaries. The ending song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgDLuuiKVPs">"One More Time, One More Chance"</a>by Masayoshi Yamazaki is a beautiful complement to an absolutely heart-wrenching ending scene that never fails to drive me to tears. This movie is a wonderful display of how hard it can be to grow up, and it also shows how love can be both a blessing and a curse.</p>
