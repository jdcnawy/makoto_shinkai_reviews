          <p>Weathering With You takes place in a world where Tokyo is experiencing seemingly endless rain showers. Hodaka Morishima, a runaway high school student, arrives in Tokyo amongst the rain. He works a part-time job to sustain himself, and runs into orphan Hina Amano by chance at her own part-time job.</p>
          <p>Their lives connect when Hodaka saves Hina from some shady men on the Tokyo streets, and discovers something astonishing about her: she is a "sunshine girl." When she prays, the sun comes out in response to her. The pair realize the potential of her ability, and start bringing the sun to the people who need it the most.</p>
          <p>Together, they start to build a meaningful life, but things aren't always that simple...</p>

<p>This movie's art and sound design are both easily 10/10, and that doesn't even begin to encompass the sheer immersiveness that they add. The rain animation, the details of the buildings and streets of Shinjuku, and the fluidity of motion in scenes with lots of camera movement leave me speechless each time I watch this film.</p>
<p>The cast of characters are very solid and aren't very cliche, which I appreciate. The two main characters are teenagers dealing with life's struggles in their own way, and all the supporting characters - kids and adults alike - really help to keep the story moving in a healthy way. My only nitpick would be Hodaka's lack of personal growth, which can probably be written off as his age showing.</p>
<p>The one thing that lets me down about this movie that lowers my overall rating would have to be the ending. It feels a little rushed and has a little too much plot convenience for me, but it does its job beautifully, and the scene where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saDmN2f3HI0">Grand Escape</a> plays makes up for it with sheer brilliance. Overall, this movie is a 8.5/10 for me.</p>
