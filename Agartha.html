          <p>Asuna Watase is a young daughter of a single mother, an exceptional student, and someone in need of distraction. She frequents her small hideout in a nearby mountain, and listens to an old crystal radio there. One day, she tuned the radio to a song of mystery and melancholy, one unlike anything she had ever heard.</p>
          <p>Soon after, a boy named Shun saves her from a dangerous creature, and she becomes attached to him. He warns her to not return to the mountains, but she does, which leads to her being dragged into a long journey.</p>
          <p>Her adventure is filled with everything from fantastical creatures, beautiful sights, and companionship to betrayal, grief, and longing.</p>
          <p>This movie grapples with the theme of death as it relates to innocence very well, and feels like a genuine homage to Studio Ghibli.</p>

  <p>The art in this movie feels very stereotypically Ghibli, to the point where a lot of the creatures and characters feel like they were taken right out of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind or Princess Mononoke. That being said, there are a lot of Shinkai-esque shots that remind you who the director here actually is. There are times where the animation feels a little weird, which is why a point is docked from art.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is a nice mix of light-hearted tracks, bittersweet orchestral tracks, and more, and the ending song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWTWXUMw-B4">"Hello, Goodbye and Hello"</a> fits the story very well. The cast is strong overall, with believable characters all around - Asuna is a great example of how to introduce a kid that struggles with loneliness, grief, and maturity.</p>
<p>Overall, the movie is very good, but notably different from most of Shinkai's portfolio. There's a lighter, more adventurous tone present, which I personally found very entertaining given the style of the movie.</p>
