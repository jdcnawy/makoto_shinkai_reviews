          <p>This website is all about Makoto Shinkai!</p>
          <p>Ever since I came across his films around three years ago, I've been in love with his directing style.</p>
          <p>At the top of the page, you'll see a navigation bar that will take you to different sections of the site. This is the homepage.</p>
        </div>
<div>
  <p>Then, we have a page giving a little bit of insight into Makoto Shinkai himself.</p><p>There will also be a link to his website for those of you that are interested!</p>
<p> Keep in mind that all reviews on this site are my opinion only! Don't take anything I say here as gospel. </p>
      </div>
<div>
<p>The far-right "Movies" tab is a dropdown menu that links to my personal reviews of all his films! (I excluded his projects that were shorter than 20 minutes, because there wasn't much to say.)</p>
<p>There will be no major spoilers, but I will talk about the events that take place in the first sections of each film for the sake of setting the scene.</p>
