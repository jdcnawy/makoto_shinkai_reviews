          <p>In Shinkai's first big feature film, Hokkaido(a northern island of Japan) was occupied by the Soviet Union after the Separation of Japan in 1945. The Union constructed a strange tower on Hokkaido, and this tower later becomes the object of fascination of three kids: Hiroki Fujisawa, Takuya Shirakawa, and Sayuri Sawatari.</p>
          <p>Hiroki and Takuya begin constructing a plane in order to reach the top of the tower one day, and the two boys name the plane the Bella Ciela. Sayuri rounds out their trio, and the two boys promise her that they'll fly her to the top of the tower one day.</p>
          <p>However, Sayuri suddenly disappears one day, and neither Hiroki nor Takuya see her again. Later on, they find out that her disapperance is actually linked to the very same tower that they have their eyes on.</p>

<p>This movie's visuals are incredible; the use of colors, lighting, and detailed backgrounds create enticing and beautiful settings. The soundtrack is great all around as per usual, and the score that Sayuri and Hiroki play on the violin is wonderful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w54-z6zpEWg">This is that violin score.</a></p>
<p>The cast of characters are good, but the main characters feel a little boring at times. Sayuri is only interesting because of the reasons behind her absence.</p>
<p>The story is good, delving into the themes of distance, time, maturity, friendship, and more. However, the back half of the film definitely struggles from some pacing issues. The ending feels out of place and a little clunky, which is a letdown for a film that does such a wonderful job at so many things. Overall, it's a good watch, but there are more glaring issues here than usual.</p>
